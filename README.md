# Problem Statement 
The purpose of this analysis is to:

Define proper KPIs
Create a dashboard for the retention manager that reflects all relevant Key Performance indicators(KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.
Based on your findings, recommend suggestions as to what needs to be changed
Here are some inputs:

Customers who left within the last month
Services each customer has signed up for: phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
Customer account information: how long as a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, total charges and number of tickets opened in the categories administrative and technical
Demographic info about customers â€“ gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents.

# Data Sourcing
The Dataset used for this analysis was presented by Pwc Switzerland and available at:

Churn Dataset

# Data Preparation
Data transformation was done in Power Query and the dataset was loaded into Microsoft Power BI Desktop for modeling.

The customer retention dataset is given by a table named:

churn which has 23 columns and 7043 rows of observation
The tabulation below shows the churn table with its column names and their description:

|Column Name      |	Description
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|

Data Cleaning for the dataset was done in power query as follows:

A new table named churn - unpivot groups was created by duplicating the churn table and unpivoting unnecessary columns. In the new table, 2 additional conditional columns were added using M-formula:

Loyalty (which describes how long as a customer):  Table.AddColumn(#"Added Conditional Column", "Loyalty", each if [tenure] < 12 then "< 1 year" else if [tenure] < 24 then "< 2 years" else if [tenure] < 36 then "< 3 years" else if [tenure] < 48 then "< 4 years" else if [tenure] < 60 then "< 5 years" else "< 6 years")

Risk category:  Table.AddColumn(#"Changed Type", "Risk category", each if [tenure] < 24 then "Risk 1" else if [tenure] < 48 then "Risk 2" else "Risk 3Table.AddColumn(#"Changed Type", "Risk category", each if [tenure] < 24 then "Risk 1" else if [tenure] < 48 then "Risk 2" else "Risk 3"Table.AddColumn(#"Changed Type", "Risk category", each if [tenure] < 24 then "Risk 1" else if [tenure] < 48 then "Risk 2" else "Risk3")

Further cleansing was done as follows:

Unnecessary columns were removed
Each of the columns in the table were validated to have the correct data type

# Data Modeling
After the dataset was cleaned and transformed, it was ready to be modeled.

A one-to-many (*:1) relationship was created between the churn and the churn - unpivot groups tables using the customerId column in each of the tables
The relationship formed in the data model is shown below:

# Data Visualization
Data visualization for the dataset was done in 3 folds using Microsoft Power BI Desktop:

The Welcome Page: Shows recommendations and a short insight on the report.

The Churn Page: Shows the churn dashboad containing # of customers at risk, # of Tech Tickets, # of Admin Ticket, Yearly Charges, Monthly charges, Demographics, e.t.c

The Customer Risk Analysis Page: Shows the # of customers, the churn rate, churn by type of internet service, type of contract, e.t.c

As shown from Data Visualization, It can be deduced that:

7043 customers are at risk of churn

The churn rate is 26.54%

The yearly charges is $16.06M

# Insights
As shown the Data Visualization, It can be deduced that:

Customers on the Two-Year contract, have been with the company for long, while most of the customers on Month-to-Month contract joined the company.

The company is at risk of losing recently joined customers. based on the results from analysis.. if they decided to month-to-month contract.

7043 customers are at the risk of churn. and The churn rate is 27% and yearly charges is $16.06M charges. and Monthly Charges is $456.12K monthly charges.

2955 tech tickets were opened and 3632 admin tickets were opened.

Most of the churned customers did not sign up for Online Security and tech support and also did not sign up for Phone Services.

It a lot of customers had an issue with Fiber Optic . Up to 42% of the customers churned were using Fiber Optic as their Internet Services.

# Recommendation

The Company could try convincing customers to subscribe to One-Year and Two-Year contract. The contract are not favorable to customers as they tend to pay more monthly.

Giving the discount to customers based on the some specific tasks is also good wat retaining them, specially those month-to-month contract.

From analysis majority customers who churned did not sigh up for Online Security and Tech Support. These are the important services that customers should customers signup for. The company should educate customers on the benefits of signing up for these services.

Increase sale of 1 and 2 year contract by 5% each and Yearly increase of automatic payments by 5%.
